# gallery-zooming-effect

. Where to Use This Animation
This effect is great for focusing the user's attention on one thing from a larger collection.
Here are a few perfect places to use it:

Portfolio: The gallery is your portfolio. The user scrolls, and one of your projects "zooms in" to become the main focus.

Team Page: You could have a grid of headshots for your team. As the user scrolls, each team member's photo and bio could zoom in and pin, one after the other.

Product Showcase: Imagine a "Shop the Look" page. A grid of outfits could zoom in to focus on one specific product (like a shoe or a jacket) as you scroll.

Hero Section: You could use this as the first thing users see. A grid of images at the top of your site could transition into the main hero image using this effect.

It's a powerful way to make your site feel interactive and guide the user through a story, one piece at a time.
